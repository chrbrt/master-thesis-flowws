ABSTRACT = {A wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) is a group of sensors and actuators that are geographically distributed and interconnected by wireless networks. Sensors gather information about the state of physical world. Actuators react to this information by performing appropriate actions. WSANs thus enable cyber systems to monitor and manipulate the behavior of the physical world. WSANs are growing at a tremendous pace, just like the exploding evolution of Internet. Supporting quality of service (QoS) will be of critical importance for pervasive WSANs that serve as the network infrastructure of diverse applications. To spark new research and development interests in this field, this paper examines and discusses the requirements, critical challenges, and open research issues on QoS management in WSANs. A brief overview of recent progress is given.},

@inproceedings{Li.2017b,
 abstract = {The revolutionary advances of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications have helped IoT emerge as an increasingly important domain for end-user development (EUD). Past research has shown that end users desire to create various customized automations, which would often utilize multiple IoT devices. Many solutions exist to support EUD across multiple IoT devices, but they are limited to devices from the same manufacturer, within the same ``eco-system'' or supporting a common API. We present Epidosite, a mobile programming-by-demonstration system that addresses this limitation by leveraging the smartphone as a hub for IoT automation. It enables the creation of automations for most consumer IoT devices on smartphones by demonstrating the desired behaviors through directly manipulating the corresponding smartphone app for each IoT device. Epidosite also supports using the smartphone app usage context and external web services as triggers and data for automations, enabling the creation of highly context-aware IoT applications.},

 abstract = {Programmers use security APIs to embed security into the applications they develop. Security vulnerabilities get introduced into those applications, due to the usability issues that exist in the security APIs. Improving usability of security APIs would contribute to improve the security of applications that programmers develop. However, currently there is no methodology to evaluate the usability of security APIs. In this study, we attempt to improve the Cognitive Dimensions framework based API usability evaluation methodology, to evaluate the usability of security APIs.},
